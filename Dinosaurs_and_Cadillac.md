Source INFO

I worked on a this side-scroller game engine few years ago, and I am very happy now to see the great and substantial progress I made on it uploaded on Google Project Pages. Its framework is based upon the classic side-scrolling games.

The fact that almost everyone with a little understanding of the platform can take this code and modify it, share it with the community and create something amazing is definitely a positive contribution to Flash game developers. Tutorials end up being copy and paste jobs, more often than not, and then people are more inclined to say "Look what I did!" and take inappropriate credit. Open source allows everyone to benefit.

This AS2 side scroller game engine is full of Run And Gun elements and contains full source code for this type of games. As well as being useful for developers looking to create a side-scrolling/run and gun like games, it's also a excellent starting point for anyone looking to create games in Actionscript 2. In this project just like in AS3 the Actionscript code is outside the FLA file - the first signs of trully OOP. Take a look through the code and learn from it as much as you can and please don't say developers never give you free lunch. Cheers, fellows
