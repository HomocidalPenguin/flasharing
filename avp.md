Story

They come out of the darkness and grab you from behind, they grab you by your arms and start dragging you to their domain all the while slime from their blood-stained teeth drips into your face. The smell becomes rancid and your panicking all the while. The next thing you know, it all goes black.....you open your eyes and try to move, but your stuck to the wall in a sticky slime, mounted on the wall like a picture. You hear the sound of the Aliens, hissing and moving, then another sound, one you dread to hear everytime you hear it. The sound of an egg hatching. But, has your eyes zoom in to focus on the ground beneath you, you see it too. The egg opens, you see it there. It crawls out of it's slimy, green home and for a second it sits there, slowly creeping towards you. It doesn't look like it has eyes, but you know it's staring at you. Then, it jumps. Your heart stops, and to you, time seems to stand still. Then one second later, the parasite wraps it's legs around your head, shoving it's embryo down your throat. After attaching itself to your face for what seems like years it just falls off. You think the worst is over, that you'll be OK. But, your nightmare is only beginning...

According to hunter folklore, the bugs evolved simultaneously on a multitude of worlds. This is nonsense, of course. Worse, it masks the horror behind the true – which is that the bugs are able to adapt to, and thrive in, any environment…. And that’s it the hunters who are primarily responsible for spreading the bugs throughout the galaxy.
