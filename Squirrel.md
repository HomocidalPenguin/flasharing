Source INFO

Making rich media for mobile consumption has never been easier since the release of the Flash Lite player for mobile devices. You can make a vector graphics game that could be played on any device regardless of its operating system or screen resolution easily as long as that device is equipped with the Flash Lite player - and lets not forget that you can play that game on a PC as well without using any emulators because the file is still a Flash movie that could be played on the Flash Player.

This source code will teach you how to create a Flash Lite game playable on the Flash Lite Player version 2 - one of the earliest versions and most restricted, but the most widely spread version as well. Our basic game could be created without using the advanced features provided in later versions. Adopting Flash Lite 2 will guarantee that the game will be compatible with the largest possible number of Flash Lite powered devices.

The game we will create is a very basic arcade game, the player merely follow the pathway of white painting without leaving it . If he fails to do that then the game ends. Our game will use very simple ActionScript concepts such as variables and conditionals. You really do not need to know much else.

To play the game on your phone, unzip the file and send it to your phone. You can alternatively play the game on your computer if you have the standalone player installed.
Sis file is also being included. Currently tested on Nokia N95, N95 8GB, N73, N80, N97 and N97 Mini.

The standalone version of the Flash Lite 2 player for Symbian devices is free and allows developers to test their Flash Lite applications and content before actual handsets start shipping with Flash Lite 2 pre-installed. This version is also available to end users who want to play back Flash Lite content and applications on Symbian devices.
