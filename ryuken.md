Story

All fighting games have the same storyline. But this time, there is a little different, a great evil has come forth. It plans to take over the word. Thus all the fighters gather, including out hero (Ruiken Hadouken), because evil can only be defeated through a fighter tournament. Our hero Ruiken Hadouken must defeat the great evil and win the love of a well known geisha. Unlike the other fighting games, it needs to turn the face manually by press the UP KEY, which can not turn to your opponent automatically. Punch and kick shares one button KEY A, and KEY S is used to jump and lowkick. Good luck, Ryuken Hadouken, it is time to save the world.

Source INFO

This as3 fighting engine contains full source code for a beat'em up game. As well as being useful for people looking to develop a martial arts-like games, it's also a good starting point for anyone looking to build games in Actionscript 3. Take a look through the code and learn from it.

Adventures of Ryuken Hadouken is an open source project to create a versatile fighting system in ActionScript 3. The aim is to create a system that handles the common functionality for all fighters, has methods for common enemy behaviour, and lets developers extend it easily with their own custom behaviours without needing to touch the core code. That may sound very technical and it actually is. Such libraries are meant primarily for "real" game programmers. However, Flash designers with a little bit of ActionScript programming know-how can also use such code. In particular, they simply may slightly adapt the excellent examples that are for download.

OK, this might sound stupid, but I need to put together a short "install manual" for Adventures of Ryuken Hadouken:

Step1: Make sure you work with Adobe Flash CS3 or later<br>
Step2: Install the MXP file (The Flint particle system open source software is developed by Richard Lord). Google "Flint Particle system" for more information how to install it. Alternatively you can run the game without it - all you have to do is to make small changes in the AS3 code files.<br>
Sep3: Run the Ryuken16.fla file
