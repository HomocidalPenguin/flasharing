Various AS2 and AS3 game engine source code released to the community by PublicGameLibrary.com

A packages of classes for creating a flash games, plus game examples have been provided.


Major changes such as fundamental changes to the gameplay, adding new levels, or adding custom score features are more advanced and a reasonable level of competence with Flash is required. If you don’t have the Flash skills yourself to make changes like these, just use my free video guide to outsourcing to quickly and cheaply have a freelance developer carry out the changes for you. They will modify the Flash games sources you provide, and send them back to you along with the published SWF game files ready to add to your site or blog, or to distrubute via your visitors by allowing them to add the games to their own sites!

Developing Flash games can be a great way of making a profit, either as a complete enterprise, or as part of an existing design or development business. If you’re new to game development then start by following game tutorials, or modifying existing game code and in time you could be writing the next blockbuster!

FLA – Flash game FLA files (.fla) are the editable source files which you open and edit when you’re creating or modifying a Flash game (or any other Flash project!). These are much larger, uncompressed files, and these are editable allowing you to customise them. These files however are not normally distributed, and are kept by the original developer to prevent their games being copied and duplicated. They contain all of the graphics, audio and data used in the project and are uncompressed. These are the files you need if you want to rebrand a Flash game, or change the graphics, or make any other changes!

SWF – Often pronounced as swif files (.swf) these are the published and compressed game files which you actually put online for your visitors to play. They are compressed so they can be quickly downloaded, and so they are not editable. To create a SWF file you first need to open the FLA file in Flash, and then select Publish. This creates the compressed SWF game file ready for use online.

AS - as files contain ActionScript source code in simple source files. FLA files can also contain Actionscript code directly, but separate external .as files often emerge for structural reasons, or to expose the code to versioning applications. They sometimes use the extension .actionscript.

If you search online for free Flash games to add to your website it will be SWF files that you find. You can quickly and easily add these to your site for your visitors to play, but they will have the original developer’s or owner’s logos and links in them, so effectively you’ll be advertising for them!

When you download and extract the archives you get the full FLA and AS game files. That means you can change those links and logos, or the graphics, or the audio, or any other part of the game for that matter!
